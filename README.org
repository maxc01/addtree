#+TITLE: AddTree Covariance Function


* dependencies

This project depends on george, numpy and scipy. george must be compiled manually.
   #+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/maxc01/george
cd george
python setup.py install
   #+end_src

If you are using [[https://python-poetry.org/][poetry]] to manage dependencies, the following commands will
install all dependencies and this project:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/maxc01/addtree
cd addtree
poetry install
#+end_src
Otherwise, you will have to install these dependencies manually. Section
=[tool.poetry.dependencies]= in =pyproject.toml= lists all dependencies and
their versions.


* examples

** synthetic function (from Jenatton2017)
   #+begin_src sh
cd examples
python addtree_jenatton_small.py
   #+end_src
log files will be located in
=exp_results/addtree/jenatton-small/a-unique-dir=. The following figure shows
comparison of different algorithms on optimizaing the synthetic function.

** model compression

    #+begin_src sh
cd examples
python {{ algo }}_model_compression_multiple.py {{ model_name }} OUTPUT_PATH --pretrained PRETRAINED_PATH --prune_epochs 1
    #+end_src
=model_name= can be "vgg16", "resnet50" or "resnet56".
=algo= can be "addtree", "random" , "tpe" or "smac".

For example, to compress resnet50 using =addtree=,
#+begin_src sh
python addtree_model_compression_multiple.py resnet50 OUTPUT_PATH --pretrained PRETRAINED_PATH --prune_epochs 1
#+end_src

The following picture shows comparison of different algorithms on compressing resnet50.
